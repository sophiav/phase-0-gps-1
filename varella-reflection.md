# GPS 1.1 - Reflections

### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The main thing i found confusing was working with GitHub and trying to merge remote and local repos. 

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git and GitHub worklows

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The guide was great in jumping in and helping us when we got stuck on a couple of points and he also gave us some tips on best practices and some new resources to check out inn regards to Markdown, which i found really useful. My pair was super helpful and patient in guiding me through some steps i kept getting stuck on while i was driving and helped me clarify a lot of the questions i had in regards the GitHub workflow. 

### What still confuses you about Git?
I still feel i need to practice a bit more on working more efficiently with Git and GitHub workflows and also spend some more time exploring the GitHub platform to familiarize myself with all its features and basic functionality.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall it was a pleasure to work with both my pair and the guide. I can see the importance of these sessions as they not only helped me clarify some issues i was still having some problems with, but the session was also a great way to practice some more with a peer and enhance the learning from the week.
