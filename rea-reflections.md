**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I am still trying to familiarize myself with the workflow of using Git with Github and with time I'm sure things will become second nature.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

It helped to see how 2 people work on a Repo and push changes to the origin to be merged etc.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

My Pair helped me a lot with the Markdown language portion and getting everything formated correctly. Gary was great A++ will sign up to be guided by him again :)

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I don't know if much confuses me at this point so much as I just want to keep using it so I won't have to think and I can just do it.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I really enjoyed pairing, at first it is a bit hard to pair remotely because I am not sure to it and I needed to be more organized. I actually found it harder to be the navigator trying to follow along with all of my screens open + also try to research etc. Overall I think it is great, and after overcoming any difficulties, I can see it will be great asset in all of our learning!
